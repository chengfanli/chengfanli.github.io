## GLKB: End-to-End Relation Extraction from Biomedical Texts

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/src/glkb1.png" style="zoom:20%;" />

In recent years, there has been a concerted effort to enhance the accessibility and utility of genomic research materials. Nonetheless, there remains a clear need for a resource that seamlessly integrates information from both genomic literature and databases, facilitating effortless access and comparison.

In this project, we have introduced the Genomic Literature Knowledge Base (GLKB). The GLKB effectively brings together genomic knowledge derived from a vast pool of more than 33 million PubMed abstracts and meticulously curated databases, all organized according to a rigorous schema. Users have the capability to select and compare results with varying confidence levels, thanks to the Python API and a user-friendly web interface.

By amalgamating insights from both literature and databases into a single, unified resource, the GLKB empowers researchers with a potent tool to expedite the pace of genomic research and discovery.

Under the supervision of Dr. Jie Liu, I worked with four peers to build the Genomic Literature Knowledge Base (GLKB), which incorporates multiple ontologies and captures the informative functional relations in the human genome. I extract entities, relationships, and events from the medical literature in the 34 million citations for biomedical literature from MEDLINE, life science journals, and online books in the PubMed database. I review and reproduce existing end-to-end NER and joint extraction models. Reproduce the DeepEventMine model and apply it to the Pubmed biomedical literature database to extract events.

## DataSifter: Statistical Obfuscation for Sensitive Clinical Diagnosis

Implement the DataSifterText2 algorithm based on models such as LightGBM, Word2vec and BERT for keywords prediction, semantic radius mining, and sensitive clinical diagnosis obfuscation from MIMIC3.
I worked under the supervision of Dr. Ivo D. Dinov and Dr. Simeone Marino at the University of Michigan’s SOCR Lab. In this work, we designed and implemented a clinical diagnosis de-identification framework focused on statistically obfuscating patients’ sensitive private information while maintaining the diagnostic notes’ readability and utility. These clinical diagnosis notes are critical for training large-scale medical models at the intersection of NLP and bioinformatics.
