### Output Comparison

Run the program with the specified `.ini` config file to compare your output against the reference images. The program should automatically save to the correct path for the images to appear in the table below.

If you are not using the Qt framework, you may also produce your outputs otherwise so long as you place them in the correct directories as specified in the table. In this case, please also describe how your code can be run to reproduce your outputs

> Qt Creator users: If your program can't find certain files or you aren't seeing your output images appear, make sure to:<br/>
>
> 1. Set your working directory to the project directory
> 2. Set the command-line argument in Qt Creator to `template_inis/final/<ini_file_name>.ini`

Note that your outputs do **not** need to exactly match the reference outputs. There are several factors that may result in minor differences, such as your choice of tone mapping and randomness.



Please do not attempt to duplicate the given reference images; we have tools to detect this.

> Note: The reference images above were produced using the [Extended Reinhard](https://64.github.io/tonemapping/#extended-reinhard) tone mapping function with minor gamma correction. You may choose to use another mapping function or omit gamma correction.

### Design Choices

#### Four basic types of BRDFS

In `BRDF.cpp`,  calculate different BRDFs based on the equation from the slides. Determine the type of BRDF based on the `mat.illum` and `mat.specular`.

In `radiance.cpp`,  calculate radiance and trace next ray.

#### Indirect illumination

See `milestone,md`.

#### Russian roulette path termination

See `pathetracer.cpp`. Use the following formula to modify $\text{pdf}_{rr}$ based on the $brdf$.

$\widetilde{\text{pdf}_{rr}} = \text{clamp}(\frac{40}{21}brdf + \frac{1}{21}, 0, 1) \cdot \text{pdf}_{rr}$

#### Event splitting & Direct lighting

See `light.cpp` and `pathtracer.cpp`. Sample light for all the emissive triangles and estimate their contribution to the rendering based on `uniform_sample_triangle`. Perform soft shadow by compare the intersection point with the sample point in `light.cpp`.

#### Tone mapping

See `tone.cpp`.  Refer to https://64.github.io/tonemapping/  for different tone mappings.

Using **Extended Reinhard (Luminance Tone Map)** with gamma correction. The difference between two `toneMap` functions is output. (one output QRgb, another output Vector3f)

#### Attenuate refracted paths

See `radiance.cpp`.

Determine whether the light is inside the material or not in `refract` function. Then calculate a `attenuate_coef` in `calculateRadiance` function.

#### Depth of field

See `depth_of_field` in `pathtracer.cpp`.

First uniformly sample a point around the origin point of the ray based on the `aperature` of the camera and then adjust the direction of the ray based on the following  equation given `focalDistance`.

$\widetilde{p} = p + \text{offset}$

$\widetilde{d} = p + d \cdot f - p$

#### BRDF importance sampling

See `importance_sampling` in `sampling.cpp`. Refer to https://ameye.dev/notes/sampling-the-hemisphere/ for sampling methods and formula.

* **Ideal diffuse**

  Use cos weighted sampling to sample points around the normal. Although the BRDF of the ideal diffuse is a constant, L is still proportional to cos(theta). 

* **Glossy specular**

  Sample rays close to the reflection direction. The halfway vector are first sampled using power cos weighted sampling to take the consideration of shininess of material. Then the final ray direction are calculated based on the halfway vector.

* **Ideal specular (mirror)**

  Output the reflection direction and $\text{pdf} = 1.0$.

* **Dielectric refraction (refraction + Fresnel reflection)**

  First use Schlickâ€™s Approximation to calculate the $R(\theta)$ and determine whether to trace reflection or refraction. Output the reflection or refraction direction and $\text{pdf} = 1.0$.

#### Fixed Function Denoising

Before denoising, tone mapping are applied to each channel to map the intensity value to 0 ~ 1. In `denoise.cpp`, the mapped intensity values for each channel are decomposed using wavelet decomposition with HAAR filter.

The denoising on wavelet coefficient are performed based on the following equation known as **wavelet shrinkage**. [Don95]

$y = \text{sign}(x) \cdot \text{max}(0, |x| - \sigma \sqrt{2\log{N}})$

Then reconstruct the figure using wavelet reconstruction.

The wavelet decomposition and reconstruction code is based on open source project simple-wavelet.



### Extra Features 

#### Attenuate refracted paths

Set `attenuate = true` inside the `.ini` file.

Example: `template_inis/extra/attenuate_refraction.ini`

 <img src="https://lllllcf.github.io/project/src/graphics/student_outputs/final/refraction.png" alt="softshadow" style="zoom:45%;" /> <img src="https://lllllcf.github.io/project/src/graphics/student_outputs/extra/attenuate_refraction.png" alt="softshadow" style="zoom:45%;" />

We can observe that the refracted light intensity on the right picture is weaker because of the attenuation.

#### Depth of field

Set `depthofField = true` inside the `.ini` file. On `[DoF]` section,  specify the value of `aperture ` and `focalDistance`.

Example: `template_inis/extra/dof.ini`

 <img src="https://lllllcf.github.io/project/src/graphics/student_outputs/final/glossy.png" alt="softshadow" style="zoom:40%;" /> <img src="https://lllllcf.github.io/project/src/graphics/student_outputs/extra/glossy_dof_3.png" alt="softshadow" style="zoom:40%;" /> 

<img src="https://lllllcf.github.io/project/src/graphics/student_outputs/extra/glossy_dof_4.png" alt="softshadow" style="zoom:40%;" /> <img src="https://lllllcf.github.io/project/src/graphics/student_outputs/extra/glossy_dof_5.png" alt="softshadow" style="zoom:40%;" />

Here are examples of glossy specular scene without dof, with `focalDistance = 3.0`, `focalDistance = 4.0` and `focalDistance = 5.0`. (all the three figures with dof has `aperture = 0.5`)

#### BRDF importance sampling

Set `importanceSampling = true` inside the `.ini` file.

* **Ideal diffuse**

  Example: `template_inis/extra/IS_diffuse.ini`

  <img src="https://lllllcf.github.io/project/src/graphics/student_outputs/final/cornell_box_full_lighting.png" alt="softshadow" style="zoom:55%;" /> <img src="https://lllllcf.github.io/project/src/graphics/student_outputs/extra/IS_cornell.png" alt="softshadow" style="zoom:55%;" />

  We can observe that the right figure with importance sampling has finer details and less noise.

* **Glossy specular**

  Example: `template_inis/extra/IS_glossy.ini`

  <img src="https://lllllcf.github.io/project/src/graphics/student_outputs/final/glossy.png" alt="softshadow" style="zoom:55%;" /> <img src="https://lllllcf.github.io/project/src/graphics/student_outputs/extra/IS_glossy.png" alt="softshadow" style="zoom:55%;" />

  We can observe that the right figure with importance sampling has smoother glossy surface and less noise .

* **Ideal specular (mirror)**

  Example: `template_inis/extra/IS_mirror.ini`

  <img src="https://lllllcf.github.io/project/src/graphics/student_outputs/final/mirror.png" alt="softshadow" style="zoom:55%;" /> <img src="https://lllllcf.github.io/project/src/graphics/student_outputs/extra/IS_mirror.png" alt="softshadow" style="zoom:55%;" />

  We can observe that the right figure with importance sampling has less noise. But for the mirror surface, we did not observe any significant difference, perhaps because the number of samples was large and the difference was not obvious.

* **Dielectric refraction (refraction + Fresnel reflection)**

  Example: `template_inis/extra/IS_refraction.ini`

  <img src="https://lllllcf.github.io/project/src/graphics/student_outputs/final/refraction.png" alt="softshadow" style="zoom:55%;" /> <img src="https://lllllcf.github.io/project/src/graphics/student_outputs/extra/IS_refraction.png" alt="softshadow" style="zoom:55%;" />

  We can observe that the right figure with importance sampling has less noise. For the refraction, we can observe that the light refracting through the sphere creates a denser and richer projection on the ground for the right figure.

#### Fixed Function Denoising

Set `denoise = true` inside the `.ini` file.

Example: `template_inis/extra/denoise_on.ini` and `template_inis/extra/denoise_off.ini`

 <img src="https://lllllcf.github.io/project/src/graphics/student_outputs/extra/cornell_box_denoise_off.png" alt="softshadow" style="zoom:45%;" /> <img src="https://lllllcf.github.io/project/src/graphics/student_outputs/extra/cornell_box_denoise_on.png" alt="softshadow" style="zoom:45%;" /> 

We can observe that right figure has reduced noise.
