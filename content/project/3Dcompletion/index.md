title: Open-ended Example-Based Shape Modeling
summary: Developed an autoregressive transformer decoder for precise part selection, leveraging extrinsic (Gaussian mixture models) and intrinsic (surface geometric information) implicit representations from SPAGHETTI to to facilitate 3D shape generation and synthesis based on a small set of example shapes.

This game was jointly developed by Xiaoyu Liu, <a href="https://yanmeeei.github.io/portfolio/">Yanmei Wang</a>, <a href="https://yushi111.github.io/">Yushi She</a>, and me. I implemented buildings, the spit skill, the growth algorithm, the vitality system, and the skill selection mechanism.
