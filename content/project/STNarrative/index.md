Welcome to Spatial-Temporal Narrative, the puzzle game where you can manipulate time and space to complete beautiful and intricate levels. As the player, you'll embark on a journey through different worlds, solving challenging puzzles by navigating through mazes without repeating your path. But you're not alone in this adventure: you have the power of time travel and space teleportation at your fingertips to help you overcome obstacles and reach the end of each level.

I developed the whole game.
