Reproduced the dungeon level of "Legend of Zelda", while retaining its exciting story, fantastic background, and interesting puzzles, some hidden mechanisms have been added for players to explore.

Welcome to Spatial-Temporal Narrative, the puzzle game where you can manipulate time and space to complete beautiful and intricate levels. As the player, you'll embark on a journey through different worlds, solving challenging puzzles by navigating through mazes without repeating your path. But you're not alone in this adventure: you have the power of time travel and space teleportation at your fingertips to help you overcome obstacles and reach the end of each level.

I developed the whole game.
