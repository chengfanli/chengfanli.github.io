Developed a rootless system package manager in Rust, transforming Conda-Forge into a universal software repository for Python-free package deployments. EM sets up a dedicated environment for running package executables and supports
global installation of Conda packages into isolated environments, enhancing accessibility and support injections.

The project is still in progress and will be released soon.
